        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This recipe started as an oatmeal coconut cookies (IMHO the coconut is what makes these cookies so delicious). Then, you can add whatever other ingredients you have in the pantry. (I plan to use pretzels next time). I think the amount of extra
          ingredients (1 &frac12; cup below) is pushing the limit of what can be added. The dough just comes together.</p>
        <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I wrote this recipe up by memory, so there's a chance it's a bit off. The general ratios of ingredients look right, so you'll definitely have decent cookies at the end. But, if something is off or different than expected,
          please let me know.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><span class="verb">Toast</span> coconut at 350&deg; F for about 10-15 minutes. Stir/toss every 5 minutes. Coconut should be golden brown. Be careful...coconut can go from golden brown to burnt very quickly. Cool completely.</li>
          <li><span class="verb">Beat</span> sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs.</li>
          <li><span class="verb">Mix</span> all other ingredients together. The flour should coat all the ingredients. Then mix into the wet ingredients.</li>
          <li><span class="verb">Scoop</span> cookies and press the dough firmly the ensure the shape is held.</li>
          <li><span class="verb">Bake</span> at 375&deg; F for about 9-13 minutes. This really depends on how big you made the cookies. Start at 9 minutes, and then just keep checking until they are done.</li>
